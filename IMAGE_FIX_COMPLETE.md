🐛 **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED: Images Now Display in Published Posts** 🖼️

## ✅ Problem Identified and Resolved

**Issue:** Images were not displaying in published blog posts, showing "Image not found" placeholders instead.

**Root Cause:** The image resolution logic in `BlogSection.tsx` (published view) was different from `BlogManager.tsx` (draft view), causing uploaded images to fail loading in published posts.

## 🔧 Technical Solution Applied

### Fixed Image Resolution Logic in Published Posts

**File:** `/src/components/BlogSection.tsx` - Line ~2260

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
// Resolve image source (check for uploaded files)
let actualSrc = src;
if (!src.startsWith('http') && !src.startsWith('data:') && !src.startsWith('/')) {
  // Try to find the image in uploadedFiles (if this is a published post with uploaded files)
  const currentPost = posts.find(p => p.content.includes(line));
  if (currentPost?.uploadedFiles) {
    const uploadedFile = currentPost.uploadedFiles.find(f => f.name === src || f.id === src);
    if (uploadedFile?.url) {
      actualSrc = uploadedFile.url;
    }
  }
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Resolve image source (check for uploaded files)
let actualSrc = src;
if (!src.startsWith('http') && !src.startsWith('data:') && !src.startsWith('/')) {
  // For published posts, check if we have a selectedPost with uploadedFiles
  if (selectedPost?.uploadedFiles) {
    const uploadedFile = selectedPost.uploadedFiles.find(f => f.name === src || f.id === src);
    if (uploadedFile?.url) {
      actualSrc = uploadedFile.url;
    }
  }
  // Fallback: try to find the image in any post's uploadedFiles
  if (actualSrc === src) {
    const currentPost = posts.find(p => p.content.includes(line));
    if (currentPost?.uploadedFiles) {
      const uploadedFile = currentPost.uploadedFiles.find(f => f.name === src || f.id === src);
      if (uploadedFile?.url) {
        actualSrc = uploadedFile.url;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Image Display to Match Draft Preview
