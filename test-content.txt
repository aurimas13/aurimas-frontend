  ○ **Synopsis**: Coding and Agentic performance comparable to Claude Sonnet. Qwen3-Coder is an open-source framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring test-time scaling. 

  ○ **My Insight**: *Qwen3-Coder key challenge laid in environment scaling. It was addressed through large-scale reinforcement learning, providing a comparison to the best LLM models.* 🤖 📂 🚀

# 2. 🔄 Expert Insight: [Complex tasks solved with a six-fold increase in performance](https://news.mit.edu/2025/study-could-lead-llms-better-complex-reasoning-0708)! 


  ○ **Synopsis**: No surprise that Large Language Models (LLMs) fall short when given a complex task. But. The test-time strategy leads to a six-fold increase in accuracy, flexibility, and performance. 


  ○ **My Insight**: *The MIT researchers show that you can get huge improvements in accuracy with a very small amount of parameter training. We are closer to human-level AI.* 🧩 🧬 🚧

# 3. 🔮 Future Watch: [Ready to earn millions through stocks with AI help](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services)? 

<u>*Hypothesis*</u>: "💡 *Claude for Financial Services could help you become a magnate in days?* " 

  ○ **Why**: Utilising Claude's Financial Analysis Solution (FAS), we can unify our financial data into a single interface. As it includes Claude's industry-leading financial capabilities (1), Claude Code with expanded usage limits (2), pre-built MCP connectors (3), and expert implementation support (4), we can build a financial monopoly by just utilising and understanding FAS. 

  ○ **My Insight**: *I like that Claude's FAS offers a fundamentally more reliable approach to analyzing financial data, enabling us to monitor portfolio performance and compare metrics across investments to identify opportunities more quickly and efficiently than traditional methods.* 📊 🧠 🏦
